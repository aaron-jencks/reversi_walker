% GAME THEORY
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to present how to write game theory in \LaTeX, I will use the most popular game in game theory called the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) as an example. The PD shows why two rational individuals might not cooperate even if cooperation is in their best interest, thus resulting in a sub-optimal outcome. The game was formalized and named by Albert Tucker.\footnote{See Poundstone, William. 1992 \emph{Prisoner's Dilemma}. New York City: Anchor Books.}

% Prisoner's Dilemma in static or normal-form
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The Prisoner's Dilemma (in static or normal-form game) consist of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A set of players} $N$, and $N = \{1, 2\}$, where $1$ stands for ``Player 1'' and $2$ stands for ``Player 2.''
	\item For each $i \in N$, a set of actions $S_{i}$---that is, \textbf{a set of actions} or {a set of strategies}---$S_{i} = \{C, D\}$, where $C$ stands for ``Cooperate'' and $D$ stands for ``Defect.'' In PD $S_{1} = S_{2} = \{C,D\}$.
	\item For each $i \in N$, a \textbf{preference relation} $\succsim_{i}$ over $S_{1} \times S_{2}$ (i.e., the Cartesian product). Instead of outcome, we usually use the term \emph{action profiles} (or strategy profiles), i.e., a combination of actions such as (DC), (CC), and so on. Players care about their actions, because their actions lead to action profiles that have payoff utilities assigned to them. Each player has a utility function $v_{i}:S_{1}\times S_{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. For any collection of sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \dots, S_{n}$, we define $S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \dots \times S_{n} = \{(s_{1}, s_{2}, \dots, s_{n})|s_{1}\in S_{1}, \dots, s_{n}\in S_{n}\}$. We call $(s_{1}, s_{2}, \dots, s_{n})$ the ordered ``n-tuples'' ordered pairs $(s_{1}, s_{2})$. This is important to show that $(1,2) \neq (2,1)$. For PD game $S_{1}\times S_{2} = \{CC, CD, DC, DD\}$. 
	
	\end{itemize}
	
	The ordering of the action profiles, from best to worst---where the first action in parentheses represents player 1's action and the second action represents player 2's action---is $(D, C)$, where player $1$ defects and player $2$ cooperates; $(C, C)$, where both $1$ and $2$ cooperate; $(D, D)$, where both $1$ and $2$ defect, and; $(C, D)$, where $1$ cooperates and $2$ defects. 


The players' preferences can be represented according to payoff functions. First, we assign a utility function $u$, such as $u_{1}$ for player 1, and $u_{2}$ for player 2. We can express the order of players' preferences as, 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{l} %{l} for left aligned array
		\text{For player $1$:}\\
		u_{1} (D, C) > u_{1} (C, C) > u_{1} (D, D) > u_{1} (C, D)\\
		\\
		\text{For player $2$:}\\
		u_{2} (C, D) > u_{2} (C, C) > u_{2} (D, D) > u_{1} (D, C)
		\end{array}
	\end{equation}
	
Then, we can assign the respective payoffs,
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{l}
		\text{For $P_{1}$:}\\
		u_{1} (D, C) = 3 > u_{1} (C, C) = 2 > u_{1} (D, D) = 1 > u_{1} (C, D) = 0\\
		\\
		\text{For $P_{2}$:}\\
		u_{2} (C, D) = 3 > u_{2} (C, C) = 2 > u_{2} (D, D) = 1 > u_{2} (D, C) = 0\\
		\end{array}
	\end{equation}

We can represent the game in a payoff matrix, also called ``normal-form game'':

	 D  &  $3, 0$ & $1, 1$\\
\end{game}
\end{table}

The traditional Prisoners's Dilemma can be generalized from its original setting (see the right matrix below): If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward payoff $R$ for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff $P$. If $1$ defects while $2$ cooperates, then $1$ receives the temptation payoff $T$, while $2$ receives the ``sucker's'' payoff, $S$. Symmetrically, if $1$ cooperates while $2$ defects, then $1$ receives the sucker's payoff $S$, while $2$ receives the temptation payoff $T$.

Finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game: The action profile $a^{*}$ in a strategic game with ordinal preferences is a Nash equilibrium if, for every player $i$ and every action $a_{i}$ of player $i$, $a^{*}$ is at least as good according to player $i$'s preferences as the action profile $(a_{i}, a^{*}_{-i})$ in which player $i$ chooses $a_{i}$ while every other player ${-i}$, with $i \neq -i$, chooses $a^{*}_{-i}$. Therefore, for every player $i$
\begin{equation}
u_{i}(a^{*}) \geq u_{i}(a_{i}, a^{*}_{-i}) \, \forall \, a_{i} \in A_{i}
\end{equation}
where $A_{i}$ is the set of actions for player $i$, and $u_{i}$ is a payoff function that represents player $i$'s preferences.

	 D  &  $\underline{3}, 0$ & $\underline{1}, \underline{1}$\\
\end{game}

Each underlined action indicates the best response of each player according to the other player's action. Therefore, $NE = (D, D)$.

The PD can also be depicted in a game of extensive-form (or decision tree), such as:

The small dot on top of each payoff indicates the best response of each player according to the other player's action. \textbf{Note:} Be careful to not confuse strategy profiles (or outputs) with payoff utilities (i.e., $(D,D)\neq(1,1)$). The equilibrium (or equilibria) of a game refers to the strategy profile(s). Therefore, $NE = (D, D)$.
