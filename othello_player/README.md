# Python Othello Player
Hi, this is my pygame implementation of reversi/othello! This player is a work in progress, the purpose of this program is to implement an extremely sophisticated AI, which hasn't been done yet, but it will!

# Usage
## Prerequisites
To use this you need the following packages:

- pygame
- tensorflow

To install them, call `pip install pygame tensorflow`, or `pip install pygame tensorflow-gpu` if you want to use your gpu for processing the AI.

# Playing
To run the program call `python main.py` It will open a window where you can play two-player reversi, single player is in the works. 

To play the game, click on the cell where you'd like to place your piece.
